# LookAndCook
LookAndCook is a GUI application developed using Python that allows users to input ingredients and cooking time to display relevant recipes that meet their criteria extracted from a multitude of well-known cooking sites. Once the user chooses their recipe, the recipe details, such as ingredients, directions, ratings and cooking time, are presented.

LookAndCook also uses the PyQt5 library to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to navigate the windows easily.

## Our Motivation
The endless number of complicated recipes found online drove our motivation to create an application that endangers the misery of not having the right ingredients, an issue exacerbated by pandemic-induced grocery shortages. Not all of us are willing to dedicate our time to a meal we donâ€™t know will be tasty.  Our application will alleviate these problems by allowing its user to input the ingredients they crave or have and the time they have to create their ideal meal. In doing so, users may step out of their culinary comfort zones by creating something new out of their everyday ingredients.

## Built with
* [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) - Used to make the GUI
* [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) - Used to add images from URLs
